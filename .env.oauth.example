# Netlify Configuration for Sveltia CMS OAuth

# This file is needed for Netlify's OAuth gateway to work with Sveltia CMS
# It should be in your site's root directory when deployed to Netlify/Cloudflare

# However, since you're on Cloudflare Pages, you'll need to set up environment variables
# in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard instead.

# For Cloudflare Pages:
# 1. Go to your Pages project settings
# 2. Environment Variables section
# 3. Add these variables:

# OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23licrwQSnbtNILt3u
# OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=f81bf2f19721c79416df10cb0526e0bb0c4741cb

# Note: These credentials should NOT be committed to Git for security!
