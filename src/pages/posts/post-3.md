After photographing over 50 weddings, I've learned exactly what gear I need to capture every moment
flawlessly. Here's a complete breakdown of what's in my camera bag and why each piece is essential.

## Camera Bodies (Always Bring Backups!)

**Primary:** Canon EOS R5

- 45MP sensor for stunning detail
- Excellent low-light performance for reception shots
- Fast autofocus that never misses the moment

**Backup:** Canon EOS R6

- Having a second body is non-negotiable. Gear fails, and you can't reshoot a wedding.

## Lenses: The Real Magic Makers

**Canon RF 24-70mm f/2.8** - My workhorse lens, perfect for ceremony, portraits, and details.

**Canon RF 70-200mm f/2.8** - Essential for ceremony shots from a distance.

**Canon RF 35mm f/1.8** - Reception photography hero, great in low light.

**Canon RF 85mm f/1.2** - Portrait perfection with dreamy backgrounds.

Remember, gear doesn't make great photosâ€”your vision and connection with clients do. But having the
right tools ensures you can execute that vision flawlessly!
