Golden hour—that magical time just after sunrise or before sunset—creates some of the most stunning
photography opportunities. The warm, soft light transforms ordinary scenes into extraordinary
images. Here are my top 5 tips for mastering golden hour photography.

## 1. Timing is Everything

Golden hour typically occurs during the first hour after sunrise and the last hour before sunset.
However, the exact timing varies by season and location. Use apps like PhotoPills or The
Photographer's Ephemeris to plan your shoots accurately.

## 2. Shoot in Manual Mode

The rapidly changing light during golden hour can confuse your camera's auto settings. Switch to
manual mode to maintain consistent exposure as the light shifts. Start with ISO 100-400, aperture
f/2.8-f/5.6, and adjust your shutter speed accordingly.

## 3. Position Your Subject Wisely

Backlit subjects create stunning silhouettes and rim lighting. Side lighting adds depth and
dimension. Experiment with different angles to see how the light interacts with your subject. Don't
be afraid to shoot directly into the sun for dramatic lens flares.

## 4. Use a Reflector

Golden hour light is beautiful but can create harsh shadows on faces. A simple gold or white
reflector bounces that gorgeous warm light back onto your subject, filling in shadows while
maintaining the golden glow.

## 5. Work Fast and Stay Flexible

Golden hour is fleeting—you might only have 20-30 minutes of perfect light. Scout your location
beforehand, have your gear ready, and be prepared to adjust your plan as the light changes. Some of
the best shots happen in those final moments before the sun disappears.

Remember, golden hour isn't just about technical perfection—it's about capturing emotion and
atmosphere. Let the light guide your creativity!
