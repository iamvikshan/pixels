A breathtaking three-day destination wedding celebration in Goa. Captured every magical moment from
the vibrant Mehndi ceremony to the emotional wedding vows by the beach. The couple wanted a
cinematic approach that told their love story, and we delivered over 500 edited photos and a
15-minute wedding film.
